The technician was so thorough and really put her at ease. Universal Inspections provided her report to both of us to give us peace of mind while sheâ€™s away at college and we just couldnâ€™t be happier with the service. She's been driving her car for months now with no issues. Thank you, Universal Inspections and a special thanks to Paul, appreciate everything you did for us!"

        text: "As a senior, I've bought plenty of cars, and I've been burned many times before. Universal Inspections sent a pro who really knew his stuff. He caught a few things the dealer conveniently 'missed,' saving me a headache and a good chunk of cash. I was able to negotiate a better deal on my car and they ended up fixing some issues that would have been a problem down the road.  Highly recommend their service to anyone, especially us older folks who just want an honest deal."

I consider myself pretty good with cars but I have to say the technician was sharp, thorough, and really explained the condition of the vehicle in detail. He caught something that I had totally overlooked.  It gave me the confidence to negotiate the asking price, make the purchase and the truck has been fantastic. Definitely worth it."
